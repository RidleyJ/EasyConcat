  <p> <strong> EasyConcat makes concatenating cell values a snap, and ignores blank cell values automatically. </strong> </p>
    To use EasyConcat, you'll need two things:  the range of cells whose value you want to concatenate, and a text delimiter you choose.  
    <p>
    The cell range--which needs to be on the same row--will be the first function parameter, and the text delimiter will come second. 
    <strong>Input the cell range when prompted just by dragging your cursor across the cells, like with most Sheets functions.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
    To concatenate cells A2 through D2 in cell E2, separated by a comma followed by a space, enter into E2: <br/>
    =EASYCONCAT(A2:D2, ", ") <br/>
    and then hitting Enter/Return.  </p>
    <p>  
   As with most functions, apply the concatenation formula to many rows by clicking the small blue square on the lower right corner
    of the desination cell and dragging down as many rows as you like.
    </p>
